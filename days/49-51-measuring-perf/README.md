# Days 49-51 Measuring performance

TBD

## Day N: Pick your application

Today is mostly watching the corresponding videos from the course. Be sure to watch the videos first. 

Then look through the apps we've already built or other applications you may have created that could use so proper error handling. 

One example that comes to mind is the text games apps we built. What happens when you enter invalid input?

Once you picked your app, you'll be ready to improve it over the next two days. 

## Day N+1: Adding error handling to the demo app

TBD

## Day N+2: Add error handling to one of your applications
