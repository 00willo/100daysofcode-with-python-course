# 13-15 Text-based Games Challenges

Now that you have seen the videos from day 13 and have some experience with classes and objects, we are going to build another, slightly more complex (but fun!) game.

Perhaps you've heard of [**Rock Paper Scissors**](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors). This game is a popular kids game played with just your hands. Make a symbol (rock, paper, or scissors) and both players show their hand at the same time and there are rules about which symbols beat which others. Check out page for details.

We are going to build **Rock Paper Scissors**. First, in the simple 3 symbol form (rock, paper, scissors). That will be Day 14. The grand finale for Day 15 will be to build a more complex variant.

Behold **15-way Rock Paper Scissors**!
